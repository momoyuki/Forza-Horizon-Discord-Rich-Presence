## Setup Guide

1. Launch forzarichpresence (download from [releases](https://github.com/1Stalk/Forza-Horizon-Discord-Rich-Presence/releases/))
2. Launch Forza Horizon and go to **Settings** -> **HUD and Gameplay**.
3. Scroll to the bottom and configure the **Data Out** settings:
   - **Data Out:** `ON`
   - **Data Out IP Address:** `127.0.0.1`

## Microsoft Store / Xbox App Users

Windows blocks UWP apps from sending data to local programs. If you play the Microsoft Store version, you need to apply a network fix:
- Click the **Fix Network** button in the app.
- Accept the Administrator prompt to add a Windows Loopback Exemption. 
- You only need to do this **once**.

## Features

- **Car Database Updates:** Click "Update Cars" to automatically fetch the latest car list from this repository.
- **Set & Forget:** Enable "Run on Startup" and "Launch Minimized" to let the app run silently in your system tray.
- **SimHub:** Fully compatible with SimHub and other software that uses your forza telemetry.
- **OpenXBL:** Update frequency is optimized to preserve your free API limits.
- **100% Safe:** No game file modifications or memory hooking/reading involved.

## Reporting Unknown Cars
 ⚠️ In Forza Horizon 6 some cars are not recognized because I don't have the database for them yet.
 Please consider reporting missing cars **<ins>directly in the app</ins>** *(field for type the car name will appear when it detects an unknown car)* this will help speed up the process.
 
 Feel free to submit a Pull Request as well (add cars in **src-tauri/cars.json**).
